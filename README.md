# Team Room Extension

## Visual Studio Extension for Team Room chat window

<section class="main-content">

### Summary

This Visual Studio Extension brings the TFS Team Room chat functionality directly into the Visual Studio IDE. From a separatewindow within the IDE, you can select your Team Project Collection and then any associated Team Rooms. The list of room participants and all messages are displayed and you can post directly to the Tem Room.

### Useage

*   Open the Team Room window. View > Other Windows > Team Room
*   Move it to the side. It sits best with the rest of your Team Explorer/Solution Explorer windows
*   Login to your Team Project Collection on either a local TFS or Visual Studio Online.
*   Select a Team Project Collection, and then a Team Room
*   Join the conversation

You can go to the Team Room in your browser and see all the fancy hyperlinks and stuff.

### Road Map

This is just the beginning...

*   Multi Project Collection and room monitoring
*   Hyperlinks, @mentions and #tags. You can still add these, but will only function as links in the browser version.
